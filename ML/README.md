# Machine Learning Python Files
Various versions of the ML algorithms coorespond to the different stages of the development of this project.
</br></br>
## Stage 1
FormatConversion.ipynb, ML_Exploratory.ipynb and First Recordings.ipynb are first created to test the XDawn model on the BCI Competition dataset as well as the first self recordings.
- FormatConversion.ipynb was used to convert the original format of the BCIC dataset to one similar to what we used in the actual app. 
- ML_Exploratory.ipynb tests the Xdown model on the reformatted BCIC dataset
- First Recordings tests the same ML model on the first self recorded dataset
- generate_epoch.py was the helper function used for generating the epochs during this stage
## Stage 2
During this stage we formalized the format of the modeling algoritms and transitioned into Powerbin classification instead of XDawn. Data visualization files were developed to help understanding the model effectiveness.
